# Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll cover how to create, deploy, and manage your first microservices using ioFog.

While your production environment will need to be setup separately, this tutorial provides a complete ioFog environment for demonstration purposes.

### Minimum Requirements
ioFog requires a Linux environment, however this Tutorial has everything already setup inside a Linux [Docker container](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) that can run on Mac or Windows as well.

  - **Linux** v3.10+ (Ubuntu, CentOS, Raspbian, etc), **macOS** 10.12+, or **Windows** 7+
  - **Docker** 1.10+

## Setup
  - [Linux](#linux)
  - [macOS](#macos)
  - [Windows](#windows)

### Linux
---
#### Install Docker
You can install the latest version of Docker with following command:

```sh
curl -sSf https://get.docker.com/ | sh
```

or

Download Docker for [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/), [Debian](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/), [Fedora](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/fedora/), or [CentOS](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/).

Next we need to install Docker Compose. For the latest instructions [see the Docker Compose Install Guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose), however it should be similar to this:

```sh
# This has version 1.22.0 hardcoded, you probably
# should change it to what ever the latest version is!

sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.22.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

#### Download Tutorial Project
Finally we need to download the Tutorial project, which will use Docker to run Linux containers for an ioFog [Agent](agents-overview), [Controller](controllers-overview), and [Connector](connectors-overview) that are already setup for you.

```sh
cd where/you/want/tutorial-project
curl -L -o tutorial.tar.gz https://github.com/ioFog/demo/archive/demo-environment.tar.gz
tar -zxvf tutorial.tar.gz --strip-components=1
```

[Once you're done, you can skip straight to the next section](#bootstrap-the-project)

### macOS
---
#### Install Docker
Docker for Mac can be installed from the Docker Store

[Download Docker from Docker Store](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)

<aside class="notifications note">
  <h3><img src="/images/icos/ico-note.svg" alt=""> New to Docker for Mac?</h3>
  <p>Docker for Mac allows you to run Linux containers on your Mac. Under the hood it uses a <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/docker-toolbox/">lightweight Virtual Machine</a> to provide the Linux environment to containers.</p>
</aside>

#### Download Tutorial Project
Next we need to download the Tutorial project, which will use Docker to run Linux containers for an ioFog [Agent](agents-overview), [Controller](controllers-overview), and [Connector](connectors-overview) that are already setup for you.

```sh
cd where/you/want/tutorial-project
curl -L -o tutorial.tar.gz https://github.com/ioFog/demo/archive/demo-environment.tar.gz
tar -zxvf tutorial.tar.gz --strip-components=1
```

or alternatively you can manually download it:

[Download Tutorial project](https://github.com/ioFog/demo/archive/demo-environment.zip)

[Once you're done, you can skip straight to the next section](#bootstrap-the-project)

### Windows
---
#### Install Docker
Docker for Windows can be installed from the Docker Store:

[Download Docker from Docker Store](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)

<aside class="notifications note">
  <h3><img src="/images/icos/ico-note.svg" alt=""> New to Docker for Windows?</h3>
  <p>Docker for Windows allows you to run Linux containers on your Windows. Under the hood it uses a lightweight Virtual Machine to provide the Linux environment to containers.</p>
</aside>

#### Download Tutorial Project
Next we need to download the Tutorial project, which will use Docker to run Linux containers for an ioFog [Agent](agents-overview), [Controller](controllers-overview), and [Connector](connectors-overview) that are already setup for you.

[Download Tutorial project](https://github.com/ioFog/demo/archive/demo-environment.zip)

Unzip the contents into your preferred working directory.

## Bootstrap the Project
Using a command prompt (or PowerShell console) navigate to the project directory we just downloaded and run:

```sh
docker-compose up --detach
```

The first time this is run it will download and build several Docker images for our ioFog setup. This may take a few minutes.

When you want to stop everything, you can use the `stop` command:

```sh
docker-compose stop
# or to stop as well as remove the container/networking:
docker-compose down
```

## Get To Know ioFog
With a working ioFog environment set up, we're now ready to [get to know ioFog](get-to-know-io-fog).
